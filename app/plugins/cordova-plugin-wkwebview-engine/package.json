Check your Xcode version by running:\n\n    xcode-select --print-path\n\nRequired Permissions\n-----------\nWKWebView may not fully launch (the deviceready event may not fire) unless if the following is included in config.xml. This should already be installed by Cordova in your platform config.xml when the plugin is installed.\n\n#### config.xml\n\n        <feature name=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\">\n            <param name=\"ios-package\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n        </feature>\n\n        <preference name=\"CordovaWebViewEngine\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n\n\nNotes\n------\n\nOn an iOS 8 system, Apache Cordova during runtime will switch to using the UIWebView engine instead of using this plugin. If you want to use WKWebView on both iOS 8 and iOS 9 platforms, you will have to resort to using a local webserver.\n\nWe have an [experimental plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine-localhost) that does this. You would use that plugin instead of this one.\n\nApplication Transport Security (ATS) in iOS 9\n-----------\n\nStarting with [cordova-cli 5.4.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova), it will support automatic conversion of the [&lt;access&gt;](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide/appdev/whitelist/index.html) tags in config.xml to Application Transport Security [ATS](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) directives. \n\nUpgrade to at least version 5.4.0 of the cordova-cli to use this new functionality.\n\nLimitations\n--------\n\nIf you are upgrading from UIWebView, please note the limitations of using WKWebView as outlined in our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues).\n\nApple Issues\n-------\n\nThe `AllowInlineMediaPlayback` preference will not work because of this [Apple bug](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6673091526656000). This bug [has been fixed](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-11452) in [iOS 10](https://twitter.com/shazron/status/745546355796389889). \n\n\n\nSupported Platforms\n-------------------\n\n- iOS\n",
