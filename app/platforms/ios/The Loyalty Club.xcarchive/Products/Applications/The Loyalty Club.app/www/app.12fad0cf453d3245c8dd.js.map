It supports\n * bubbling / capture, preventDefault, stopPropagation, stopImmediatePropagation, and handleEvent.\n *\n * EventDispatcher also exposes a {{#crossLink \"EventDispatcher/on\"}}{{/crossLink}} method, which makes it easier\n * to create scoped listeners, listeners that only run once, and listeners with associated arbitrary data. The\n * {{#crossLink \"EventDispatcher/off\"}}{{/crossLink}} method is merely an alias to\n * {{#crossLink \"EventDispatcher/removeEventListener\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n *\n * Another addition to the DOM Level 2 model is the {{#crossLink \"EventDispatcher/removeAllEventListeners\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n * method, which can be used to listeners for all events, or listeners for a specific event.
